# Documentation Hub

This directory is the central documentation portal for the disassembly project. Existing research notes remain authoritative for their documented scope; this hub connects them with shared project standards, version tracking, reconstruction, matching, and asset workflows.

## Working flow

1. Identify the exact target in `VERSIONS.md`.
2. Record evidence according to `RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`.
3. Reconstruct code/data under `DISASSEMBLY_STANDARDS.md` and organize project material under `PROJECT_STANDARDS.md`.
4. Use `BUILD_AND_MATCHING.md` and `VERIFICATION.md` to measure progress.
5. For asset work, follow `ASSET_WORKFLOW.md` and update manifests/checksums.
6. Update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` and `ROADMAP.md` at meaningful milestones.

Do not create empty directory trees merely for appearance; preserve and extend the repository's actual verified architecture.
